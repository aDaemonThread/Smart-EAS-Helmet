#Smart Emergency Alert System Helmet

Helmets are necessary to wear as a safety gear to prevent injuries in an accident. When we can't prevent a crash or impact, we know it will occur, a helmet can prevent or minimize injury to the head and brain. Thus it is compulsory to wear the helmet in almost every country. 

This project looks into the problems that can be solved by improving the functionality of the helmet we use every day in our normal life. Problems like late arrival of Emergency service at accident spot, Difficulty in determining exact accident location, Lack of information on Bike rider/s, detecting drank and drive. 

The prototype developed in this research paper will have features like determining the exact accident location, text alert to nearest hospital and to the rider’s emergency contact. This alert will contain the accident location and rider’s details. Our system can also detect whether the rider is under influence of alcohol. 

This prototype is a standalone system, which can detect the accident using the impact on the helmet and will detect the current location of the rider. It will then search for the nearest hospital available with emergency service. A text alert will be send to the nearest hospital and the emergency contact of the rider containing the accident location and rider’s details including vital information like blood group. 

This prototype will be powered by the 10000mAh capacity lithium-ion battery. This battery will power our system for 10 hours in one charge. This system is designed to save life in accidents, which are lost due to lack or late emergency service and lack of information of rider.
